This library introduces the implementation of named parameters for the
[`postgresql-simple`][pgs] library. `postgresql-simple-named` is considered to
be used along with the [`postgresql-simple`][pgs] library, so you could refer
there for the original documentation of primary functions. This package solves
exclusively one particular problem â€” gives the ability to use named parameters
instead of `?` in quasi-quoter queries and offers essential functions for substituting variables
them in queries (`queryNamed`, `executeNamed`).

## Example

Using the provided operator `=?` for named parameters creation and using '?'
prefix for specifying the parameters inside the queries, here is how the query
could look like:

```haskell
queryNamed dbConnection [sql|
    SELECT
        id, name, city
    FROM users
    WHERE name = ?nameParam
      AND age  = ?ageParam

|] [ "nameParam" =? "John"
   , "ageParam"  =? 42
   ]
```

This feature can be extremely helpful when the query using some parameters more than once:

```haskell
query dbConnection [sql|
    SELECT
        col1, col2
    FROM my_table
    WHERE id = ?
      AND (? IS NULL OR id > ? )
      AND (? IS NULL OR id < ? )

|] (someId, minId, minId, maxId, maxId)
```

This is how the query looks like with the `postgresql-simple` library. You can
rewrite it the following way using the `postgresql-simple-named` library:

```haskell
queryNamed dbConnection [sql|
    SELECT
        col1, col2
    FROM my_table
    WHERE id = ?someId
      AND (?minId IS NULL OR id > ?minId )
      AND (?maxId IS NULL OR id < ?maxId )

|] [ "someId" =? 42
   , "minId"  =? 1
   , "maxId"  =? 100
   ]
```

## How to build

Build the library with either `cabal new-build` or `stack build`.

## How to test locally

* Run DB in a Docker in a separate terminal window using command:
  ```
  docker run -p 5432\:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=pg_named postgres\:10.5-alpine
  ```
* Run tests using `cabal new-test` or `stack test`
